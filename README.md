Train Station (Egress)
======================

Implementing a web and mobile game with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

It includes mobile Android and Web clients both using the [Firebase client APIs](https://www.firebase.com/docs/)
This project also provides a App Engine backend used for the game play (mainly resetting station owners) and game analytics (via log export to BigQuery).

The train stations are from this French government Open Data set: [Gares ferroviaires de tous types, exploit√©es ou non](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/gares-ferroviaires-de-tous-types-exploitees-ou-non/)

The Android application was built using Android Studio and uses the [Firebase Android SDK](https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/api/) for data backend and real-time features.

The backend is a Maven project which can be used in your favorite IDE (including Android Studio!).

**This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.**
